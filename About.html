						<p class="para2">The projects presented in this site are the major class projects I did in my Communications Lab class. This portfolio site itself is one of those projects. Communications Lab is a required course for Interactive Media, and I'm taking it with Professor Jiwon Shin. The class has been super fun and the projects have been really engaging and intriguing to work on.</p>
